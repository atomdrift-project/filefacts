//! Best-effort, non-blocking cache reclamation.
//!
//! A cache here is a directory of entries, each carrying an mtime. A *sweep*
//! deletes the oldest entries until the directory is within an age, count and
//! size budget. The whole thing runs on one detached thread that dies with the
//! process — no daemon, no async runtime, no persistent index.
//!
//! The count ceiling is the one that usually binds: entries are small, so a
//! byte budget alone lets a directory reach millions of files, which every
//! filesystem tool handles badly and which makes the sweep meant to fix it
//! progressively more expensive.
//!
//! Two properties keep it cheap and safe:
//! - A `.last-sweep` marker gates the walk, so the common case is a single
//!   `stat`, never a scan of a million-entry directory. The marker records
//!   whether the sweep it names *finished*: a detached thread dies with its
//!   process, and a sweep cut short that way must not book itself as a full
//!   day's work, or a cache too large to sweep in one short run would never be
//!   swept at all.
//! - Every filesystem error is ignored: reclaiming disk must never disturb the
//!   program it runs alongside. These caches are written once and never
//!   rewritten, and on Unix unlinking a file another thread has open leaves that
//!   reader's descriptor valid, so a concurrent reader never sees a torn file.
//!
//! Moved here from stng, which no longer keeps disk caches: consumers that link
//! filefacts (scan) reuse the mechanism, and fletch keeps its own copy.
